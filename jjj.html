            <p class="verse">Verse 1</p>
            <p>
                Two old friends meet again<br>
                Wearin' older faces<br>
                And talk about the places they've been<br>
		Two old sweethearts who fell apart<br>
		Somewhere long ago<br>
                How are they to know<br>
		Someday they'd meet again<br>
		And have a need for more than reminiscin'<br>
               
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">Chorus:</p>
            <p>
                Maybe this time<br>
                It'll be lovin' they'll find<br>
                Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br>
		She's back in his life<br>
		And it feels so right<br>
		Maybe this time, love won't end<br>
            </p>
            <p class="verse">Verse 2</p>
            <p>
                It's the same old feeling back again<br>
                It's the one that they had way back when<br>
                They were too young to know when love is real<br>
		But somehow, some things never change<br>
		And even time hasn't cooled the flame<br>
		It's burnin' even brighter than it did before<br>
		It got another chance, and if they take it...<br>
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">Chorus:</p>
            <p>
                Maybe this time<br>
                It'll be lovin' they'll find<br>
                Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br>
		She's back in his life<br>
		And it feels so right<br>
		Maybe this time, love won't end<br>
	    </p>
            <p class="verse">Verse 2</p>
            <p>
 		She's smilin' like she used to smile way back then<br>
		She's feelin' like she used to feel way back when<br>
		They tried, but somethin' kept them<br>
		Waiting for this magic moment<br> 
	    </p>
            <p class="chorus">Chorus:</p>
            <p>
		Maybe this time<br>
		It'll be lovin' they'll find<br>
		Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br>
		She's back in his life<br>
		And it feels so right<br>
		Maybe this time...<br>

		Maybe this time<br>
		Maybe this time love won't end.<br>
